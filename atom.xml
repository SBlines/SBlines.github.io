    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fourth Post H1
Looks like the third post didin&rsquo;t send to the correct place but I can see it in the preview, along with an updated theme.
I enjoyed my week here at Fullstack and am looking forward to the rest of my time here.
Some of the Ruby has been difficult. While I didn&rsquo;t do most of the testing, it didn&rsquo;t look so difficult when we went over the problems and I was able to see how the programs ran. I think that with time I will become more aware of what Ruby can do and how to make it happen. I have since begun the Haiku project, which doesn&rsquo;t seem as difficult as I had initially thought. It all comes down to getting Ruby to do what I need it do. All that&rsquo;s left for me is to find the right commands.
Pair programming worked out well. I liked being a part of a team and it was interesting to see how Vin and Scott think in relation to the code. I found that Vin and I had a more similar approach. I am interested in working with the rest of the students but feel I should be more prepared next time, in order to contribute more to the code.</p>
