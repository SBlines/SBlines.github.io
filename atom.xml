    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>End of Week 4</h1>

<p>This week has been difficult. If I&rsquo;m able to figure out some of the parts to each program, I still can&rsquo;t piece them all together to see how the whole thing works. So far Ruby has been easier to work with but that could be because I&rsquo;ve had some more time to spend working with it than with Rails. It seems like in the long run I might prefer Rails.
I have been trying to pick apart a Ruby tutorial game, where a ship is moved across the screen to collect items. There are plenty of variables to affect the speed of the ship and generation of stars and I&rsquo;ve been testing them all out, adding in notes to help me remember.
I found that Codeschool will work on Chrome, as Safari wasn&rsquo;t loading theings correctly. Somestimes I would try to do some Zombies on my Mac but the videos wouldn&rsquo;t load. Still working on Ruby Bits but it&rsquo;s been slow because of display problems on Safari. THe slides are zoomed-in too much that it&rsquo;s not easy to switch between them while answering the questions. I want to show my younger cousins these courses over the holidays to give them an idea of what coding is.
The Dev Stackup on Tuesday evening was interesting. I liked hearing about the things everyone did at work and what these creations were used for. I start to wonder how many things I use are coded by people nearby. I also liked hearing that places are hiring, which has never been the case since I finished radiology school. That&rsquo;s more of an incentive for me to study and work hard.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>End of Week 3</h1>

<p>I feel like we&rsquo;re really getting into things now and am trying to think ahead so that I&rsquo;m not wondering &lsquo;where did the time go?&rsquo; once we get to December. I miss this place already.</p>

<p>Stackworld was a lot of fun this week. My favorite part was the interaction, that there was more to it than typing a few things and just looking at the output. I was able to customize the player pages a bit and felt really good helping others do the same. For once I wasn&rsquo;t poking around trying to see who could help me, instead a few guys were gathered around my screen to look at the code. I spent some freetime creating rooms and have more of the world planned out.</p>

<p>I barely got any prep work done this week. I&rsquo;ve been too tired by the time I leave that I can&rsquo;t concentrate on anything else. Even reading the web-scraping info last night was taking longer than it should have. I&rsquo;ll take another look at Ruby Bits where I was stuck, and possibly the Treehouse Ruby tomorrow.</p>

<p>Maybe at some point I&rsquo;ll look into a comments section for the blog.</p>

<p>While waiting for 1-on-1 chats to continue I focused on Codecademy&rsquo;s Ruby work. If I can get more of the general concepts under control, I&rsquo;ll have an easier time with anything Ruby-related rather than the specific tasks needed for the exercises. While the exercises are a good way to prove what I know by putting my knowledge to use, there&rsquo;s not so much knowledge available right now. I&rsquo;m working on the Object-Oriented Programming I section with classes and being able to read about them while practicing the lesson in repl seems to be working.
As frustrating as things can get I kept in mind that I only need time to work at my own pace (while hoping that I don&rsquo;t become severely out-paced by the curriculum). Regardless of how my learning progress compares to the rest of the class, I&rsquo;ll get things done. This downtime has already proved to be very worthwhile and there is still an hour before I go in for the chat.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>End of Second Week</h1>

<p>Today completes our second week at Fullstack Academy. I am enjoying my time here and have not re-thought my decision to leave my job in order to dedicate myself to the program. This is also my last day at the hospital which once again means I will have to leave early and skip some of whatever plans are in store for us.</p>

<p>I was able to contribute more to our group projects this week which I was happy about. It was more like figuring out patterns and repeating them for different parts of the program rather than knowing what to do from the beginning, which leads to my next topic:</p>

<p>Sleep. I will now have a normal sleeping schedule which should help me stay awake in class. I worry that my learning capability has been hindered these two weeks and I miss out on time to complete the prep work. Even Sunday afternoon I found myself watching the same videos and re-reading paragraphs because I couldn&rsquo;t focus.
I still need to figure out Ruby classes and their relation to methods and instances. The information is mine for the taking, I just need to figure it out. In 12th grade I couldn&rsquo;t get a grasp on physics until studying for the midterms in January or February, though I plan on getting things done within the week, not five months.</p>

<p>Going upstate tonight but if anything I&rsquo;ll bring some Ruby and JavaScript books for the train.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fourth Post H1
Looks like the third post didin&rsquo;t send to the correct place but I can see it in the preview, along with an updated theme.
I enjoyed my week here at Fullstack and am looking forward to the rest of my time here.
Some of the Ruby has been difficult. While I didn&rsquo;t do most of the testing, it didn&rsquo;t look so difficult when we went over the problems and I was able to see how the programs ran. I think that with time I will become more aware of what Ruby can do and how to make it happen. I have since begun the Haiku project, which doesn&rsquo;t seem as difficult as I had initially thought. It all comes down to getting Ruby to do what I need it do. All that&rsquo;s left for me is to find the right commands.
Pair programming worked out well. I liked being a part of a team and it was interesting to see how Vin and Scott think in relation to the code. I found that Vin and I had a more similar approach. I am interested in working with the rest of the students but feel I should be more prepared next time, in order to contribute more to the code.</p>
