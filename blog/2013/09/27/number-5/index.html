<p>Today completes our second week at Fullstack Academy. I am enjoying my time here and have not re-thought my decision to leave my job in order to dedicate myself to the program. This is also my last day at the hospital which once again means I will have to leave early and skip some of whatever plans are in store for us.
I was able to contribute more to our group projects this week which I was happy about. It was more like figuring out patterns and repeating them for different parts of the program rather than knowing what to do from the beginning, which leads to my net topic:
Sleep. I will now have a normal sleeping schedule which should help me stay awake in class. I worry that my learning capacity has been hindered these two weeks and I miss out on time to complete the prep work. Even Sunday afternoon I found myself watching the same videos and re-reading paragraphs because I couldn&rsquo;t focus.
I still need to figures out classes and their relation ot methods and instances. The information is mine for the taking, I just need to figure it out. In 12th grade I couldn&rsquo;t get a grasp on physics until studying for the midterms in January or February, though I plan on getting things done within the week, not five months.
Going upstate tonight but if anything I&rsquo;ll bring some Ruby and JavaScript books for the train.</p>
