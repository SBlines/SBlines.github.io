<p>I started this week off with a cold on Sunday night. I was being careful to keep my hands clean and not breathe on anything and I think by now I would have known if anyone else became sick. Usually after one night of quality sleep I can recover.</p>

<p>Monday and Tuesday were spent going over the assessment. I felt like I was in bad shape on Friday, after trying to take the test without notes and wanted to be in the review group. I ended up not going to Comic Con on Friday or the release event at Nintendo World because I felt I should review more instead. Despite spending all day at Javits on Saturday and Sunday, I got through most of the Ruby Learn to Program book. Next I need to read-up on Rails.</p>

<p>The review went well, especially teaching it to each other and going over the programs in a way geared towards someone less experienced. Imon was asking questions I would only expect from a non-dev, things like what is a block and what do we need &lsquo;i&rsquo; for, which helped my explanations bring the whole code together. After two days we moved on to the Rails project.</p>

<p>I am slowly figuring out Rails and can see why it&rsquo;s used so often. My plan this weekend is to get through the tutorials and make one or two small things on my own. In the two days we had for our current project, I spent time learning how the different files connect and what is needed to link them together. I had help with the routes file and now know how to embed links. Right now I would choose Ruby over Rails but am willing to put more time into Rails.</p>

<p>Our group worked together well, except for a few small details that we spent too much time arguing on. It reminded me of high school math class where I could say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right and you probably aren&rsquo;t so we&rsquo;ll do it my way,&rdquo; except I wasn&rsquo;t so confident with my Rails knowledge. We broke into two teams of two, and them Imon and I ended up working by ourselves to finish a few parts. I liked being part of a team. I felt like I really had to get to work and not rely on the other person to correct everything I type. After a few issues I was able to get my job done. I also tried the orders and started to look into Stripe but by Thursday night after the chat our team had slowed down and we didn&rsquo;t work on the project further. I didn&rsquo;t want to leave yet so I worked on Ruby Bits.</p>

<p>I feel much better about my progress this week now that things are coming together. I have also contacted a small startup in Baltimore about a Ruby internship. I might rather get right into the big jobs but if I can learn more while making some money it might work out better to start this way, even take a break from NYC for a few months and see what happens. My buddy lives down there but he&rsquo;s married now so I probably won&rsquo;t be staying with him.</p>
