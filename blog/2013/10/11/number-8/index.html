<p>This week has been difficult. If I&rsquo;m able to figure out some of the parts to each program, I still can&rsquo;t piece them all together to see how the whole thing works. So far Ruby has been easier to work with but that could be because I&rsquo;ve had some more time to spend working with it than with Rails. It seems like in the long run I might prefer Rails.
I have been trying to pick apart a Ruby tutorial game, where a ship is moved across the screen to collect items. There are plenty of variables to affect the speed of the ship and generation of stars and I&rsquo;ve been testing them all out, adding in notes to help me remember.
I found that Codeschool will work on Chrome, as Safari wasn&rsquo;t loading theings correctly. Somestimes I would try to do some Zombies on my Mac but the videos wouldn&rsquo;t load. Still working on Ruby Bits but it&rsquo;s been slow because of display problems on Safari. THe slides are zoomed-in too much that it&rsquo;s not easy to switch between them while answering the questions. I want to show my younger cousins these courses over the holidays to give them an idea of what coding is.
The Dev Stackup on Tuesday evening was interesting. I liked hearing about the things everyone did at work and what these creations were used for. I start to wonder how many things I use are coded by people nearby. I also liked hearing that places are hiring, which has never been the case since I finished radiology school. That&rsquo;s more of an incentive for me to study and work hard.</p>
